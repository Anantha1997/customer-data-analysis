# customer-data-analysis

The data provides customer and data level transactions for few years. It can be used for demonstration of any analysis that requires transaction information like RFM. The data also provide response information of customers to a promotion campaign.                              
-- A brief description about this project:

1) This project is about RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monitory value) modeling that helps maximize sales.
2) RFM's primary objective usually is to find customer's value ( who your best customers are)
3) There may not be a requirement of any prediction (i.e. building a predictive model), except if you find any scope.

# Steps of RFM

1) Calculate recency, frequency, and monetary value of each customer.
2) Add segment bin value of a RFM table using quartiles.
3) Sort the customer RFM score in the ascending order.
